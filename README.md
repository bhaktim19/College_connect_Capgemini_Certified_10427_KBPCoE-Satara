## Program Overview

Capgemini, as part of its CSR initiative, has partnered with EduBridge to offer a program designed to master front-end development and provide a solid foundation in full-stack development. The curriculum includes in-depth coverage of the following technologies:
- Core Java 8

- Spring 5.0
- HTML 5
- CSS 3 with Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Angular

This is not an exhaustive list, and the detailed curriculum can be found in the course materials.

## Training Structure

During the 4-month training period, I engaged in a variety of activities and assessments to strengthen my technical skills. The online portal facilitated coding assessments, providing a platform to demonstrate proficiency in the covered technologies. Additionally, live projects were implemented and uploaded to this GitHub repository, serving as a portfolio to showcase my experience and skills to potential employers.

## Additional Training
In addition to technical skills, the program also focused on developing aptitude and communication skills to align with industry requirements. This holistic approach ensures participants are well-prepared for job opportunities in the full-stack development domain.
I have registered on coding platforms HackerRank and HackerEarth also and developed my analytical and logical thinking skills.

## Certificates

I am currently working on the Certified Java Full Stack Professional program, and the certificates gained during the overall program can be found in the `/certificates` directory.
